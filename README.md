Welcome to this repository! This is a bot I have made in Python for help in moderation, some games, some random fun commands, etc. This is my first bot that I have made and will the one where I see and add new changes from time to time. So it's kinda an alpha version of my bot. Feel free to use the code inside and do notify if you have some good suggestions
